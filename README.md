### About this project.

Completed for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-mini-message-board) Node / Express Course.

This is a very simple web application that allows users to submit a message and username to the webpage. There isn't much to it, so I didn't bother doing any styling.

### Frameworks

This project was built using Node / Express and thats it!

### Takeaways

This project was very simple, but it reinforced the basic Express concepts that I've been learning while following the MDN [Express Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website), and taught me how to deploy an application via Heroku.
